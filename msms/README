===========

This directory contains two filters for processing molecular surfaces
produced by Michael Sanner's program msms.  One is a perl script; the
other is written in C.  Both work, but neither has been extensively
tested.

The msms home page is

    http://www.scripps.edu/pub/olson-web/people/sanner/html/msms_home.html

Files provided here:

    msms2r3d.c		C source for a conversion program
    msms2r3d.pl		perl source for a conversion program
    example.script	example script that runs msms and converts the
    			output for use in Raster3D

Notes:

The -density option to msms is particularly useful in producing high
quality figures.  A larger value causes the molecular surface to be 
tesselated more finely, which makes the rendered surface smoother.  
Caution: finer tesselation yields a *big* surface description file,
and you may have to increase the value of MAXOBJ in parameters.incl
so that render can handle that many triangular facets.

The example script assumes that msms and pdb_to_xyzr have already
been installed.
