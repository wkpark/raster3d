The file Raster3D_2.4j.tar.Z contains the full source distribution for
version 2.4j of RASTER3D.

This is a unified distribution which has been tested on the following 
machines:

	Alpha / OSF 4.0
	SGI / Irix 5.3 / Irix 6.1 6.2 6.5
	IBM RS6000 / AIX
	Intel Pentium / linux (Redhat)

For optimal use of Raster3D you should also obtain 
John Cristy's ImageMagick package for image manipulation and viewing 
	(www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html)
Some version of a TIFF library
	(e.g. via ftp from sgi.com)
Some version of a JPEG library
Version 2.0 of Molscript (http://www.avatar.se/molscript)



New in version 2.4j:

- new object types for render
	type 17:	explicit vertex colors can now be specified
			for cylinders as well as for triangles.

- other changes to render
			Support for JPEG folded back into render itself
			(was in separate program render_jpeg).
			The -DIMAGEPIPE compilation option permits render
			to pipe output directly to ImageMagick for conversion
			to other image formats. For example, 
			    render -out image.ppm < infile.r3d
			will use ImageMagick to produce a PBM+ image file.
			The entire set of header records can be specified
			via file indirection, so the input stream to render
			can consist entirely of file references, as in
			    @header.r3d
			    @protein.r3d
			    @labels.r3d

- New programs
	r3dtops		A re-worked label processing utility.
			Scans a Raster3D input file for label commands and
			converts them to PostScript.
	label3d		A shell script to drive render and r3dtops in parallel
			so that both the graphics objects and the labels are
			merged into a single output image label3d.tiff.
			Requires ghostscript and ImageMagick to be installed.

- /materials		Expanded collection of sample material definitions
			illustrating various transparency modes, 2-sided
			objects, metallic surfaces, and so forth.
			If you set the environmental variable R3D_LIB to
			point to this directory, then file indirection in
			render input scripts will look here to resolve 
			requests for materials.
