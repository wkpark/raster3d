The file Raster3D_2.4g.tar.Z contains the full source distribution for
version 2.4g of RASTER3D.

This is a unified distribution which has been tested on the following 
machines:

	Alpha / OSF 4.0
	SGI / Irix 5.3 / Irix 6.1 6.2
	IBM RS6000 / AIX
	Intel Pentium / linux (Redhat)

For optimal use of Raster3D you may also want to obtain 
John Cristy's ImageMagick package for image manipulation and viewing 
	(www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html)
Some version of a TIFF library
	(e.g. via ftp from sgi.com)
Version 2.0 of Molscript (http://www.avatar.se/molscript)



New in version 2.4:

- new object types for render
	type 14:	generalized quadric surface, e.g. an ellipsoid
	type 15:	(ISOLATE flag) prevents following object[s] from
			being transformed by the view matrix in the header.
			That is, is causes the following objects to be
			interpreted in a coordinate space centered on (0,0,0)
			with unit extent in X, Y, and Z.
	type 16:	Global rendering options (e.g.depth-cueing)
	type 17:	explicit vertex colors for triangles, 
			allows smoother coloring of triangular mesh surfaces
			(used by the ungrasp utility)

- other changes to render
			File names given for input redirection to render or
			to normal3d are looked for first in the current 
			directory, then in the directory specified by the
			environmental variable R3D_LIB.  Normally you would
			set this to /usr/local/src/raster3d/materials 
			or whatever variant of that is appropriate for your
			installation.

			EYEPOS = 0.0 disables all perspective 

			much information to terminal put under control of 
			    -debug option 

			allow # to denote comment line in render input stream

- New programs
	rastep		generates thermal ellipsoid representations of atoms
			based on ANISOU records in PDB file. Also allows
			isotropic representation with size and colour based
			on isotropic B values.  This program is still under
			development, and more than one version may be in this
			kit.

	render_jpeg	alternative version of the rendering program that
			produces a JPEG (JFIF) image stream on stdout
			instead of the normal output  options.

- /materials		subdirectory containing sample material definitions
			illustrating various transparency modes, 2-sided
			objects, metallic surfaces, and so forth.
			If you set the environmental variable R3D_LIB to
			point to this directory, then file indirection in
			render input scripts will look here to resolve 
			requests for materials.
