The file Raster3D_2.5f.tar.Z contains the full source distribution for
version 2.5f of RASTER3D.

- Version 2.5f contains no major changes or additions
  See CHANGELOG for complete list

- 2.5f adds an explicit BACKCLIP command that affects all objects in the 
  figure. Further tweaking of the Z-clip code in general.

- 2.5e added support for uncompressing input files to render and normal3d. 
  Unfortunately this is not correctly handled by g77; 
  executables produced by the g77 compiler leave temporary files cluttering 
  up the system temp directory. The same is true for the AIX xlf compiler.

- New Makefile.pgf77 for use with the Portland Group fortran compiler under
  linux (recommended!).

This is a unified distribution which has been tested on the following 
machines:

	Alpha / OSF 4.0
	SGI / Irix 6.2 6.5
	IBM RS6000 / AIX
	SUNOS (g77/gcc)
	Intel Pentium / linux (Redhat 6.1, Mandrake 7.1)  (g77/pgf77)

Previous versions have been tested under Irix 5.3 and other
flavors of linux.  If you run into installation problems, please let
me know (particularly if you can also tell me what you needed to fix!)

For optimal use of Raster3D you should also obtain 
John Cristy's ImageMagick package for image manipulation and viewing 
	(www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html)
Some version of a TIFF library
	(e.g. via ftp from sgi.com)
Some version of a JPEG library
Version 2.0 of Molscript (http://www.avatar.se/molscript)


New in version 2.5:

- new command line options to render that supercede header contents:

    -aa                   anti-aliasing (SCHEME 4)
    -alpha                alpha channel in output image (SCHEME 0)
    -debug                verbose output while running
    -draft                no anti-aliasing (SCHEME 1)
    -fontscale FF         multiplier for PostScript font size
    -labels               write labels to PostScript file label3d.ps
    -invert               invert y axis
    -size HHHxVVV         specify size of output image in pixels

- other changes to render
			Label processing (previous stand-alone program
			r3dtops) folded into the render program. Scripts
			label3d and stereo3d modified to match this change.
			Indirect file references default to extension *.r3d

- Documentation
			HTML documentation now in separate subdirectory.
			Includes an interactive tool r3d_colorpicker.html
			The manual is now distributed as a PDF file.

- New programs
	rings3d		creates sold-plane descriptions of ring systems
			in TRP, PHE, HIS residues, nucleotide bases,
			sugar rings. See example6 figure.

- /materials		Expanded collection of sample material definitions
			illustrating various transparency modes, 2-sided
			objects, metallic surfaces, and so forth.
			If you set the environmental variable R3D_LIB to
			point to this directory, then file indirection in
			render input scripts will look here to resolve 
			requests for materials.
