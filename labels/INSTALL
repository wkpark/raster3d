I have built and tested these bits of code only under Digital Unix
and linux.  


label3d
=======

The main tool to be built and installed here is the r3dtops program, and
the label3d script which drives it.

	make r3dtops
	make install

To run the script on a sample Raster3D input file containing labels, 
type
	label3d example1.r3d
	display label3d.tiff

Note that the label3d script requires that you have already installed
ghostscript and ImageMagick.

Documentation for both r3dtops and label3d is in the doc subdirectory.

r3d_label
=========

This is a very simple-minded test program illustrating another approach
to label generation. It requires the GLUT graphics library (normally
built on top of OpenGL or MESA).

To build:
	make r3d_label
To test:
	r3d_label 10. "This is a test" > label1.r3d
	r3d_label  8. "\nof r3d_label" > label2.r3d
	render -tiff example2.tiff < example2.r3d
	display example2.tiff
