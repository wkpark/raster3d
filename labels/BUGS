This whole thing is not quite ready for prime time, but it does work.

Problems:

- The label3d script is hard-wired to use -fontscale 3.0, which is approximately
  correct for eventual printing at 300dpi.  That is, if you request a 12 pt font
  and print the resulting image at 300dpi it really does come out approximately
  12 pt.  If you are printing at some other resolution (or viewing on a monitor
  screen) this factor is wrong and your fonts will either be huge or tiny.
  
- The stereo3d script doesn't yet know about label processing.
