To install Raster3D 
===================

1) copy the appropriate Makefile.xxx for your machine to Makefile

2) inspect the Makefile to make sure that it is appropriate for your site,
   and possibly edit the file to include TIFF or LIBIMAGE support.

   In order to build Raster3D so that it supports the direct output of
   TIFF image files you must
	1) Obtain and install the TIFF library. There are a number of
	   implementations available on the net.  I have been using
	   Sam Leffler's version 3.3beta, available via anonymous ftp
	   from sgi.com.
	2) Edit the INCLUDES and LIBS definitions in the Makefile,
	   INCLUDES = -DTIFF_SUPPORT
	   LIBS     = -ltiff

   On SGI machines you may want to build in support for direct output to
   image files compatible with the libimage utilities.  In this case you
   must
	1) Make sure that libimage.a is installed on your machine
	   (the source is on one of the optional installation kits in the
	   standard Irix distribution).
	2) Edit the INCLUDES and LIBS definitions in the Makefile,
	   INCLUDES = -DLIBIMAGE_SUPPORT
	   LIBS     = -limage

3) Install the package:
	make install

4) Go to the examples subdirectory and try running the example scripts
   to verify installation.

A sample installation on a DEC Alpha might go:
	cp Makefile.osf Makefile
	vi Makefile                    # to check options, etc
	make install

Notes -

	Although a Makefile.aix is provided for the IBM RS6000, I don't have
access to one to verify that things work properly.  I do know that the xlf 
compiler doesn't like the "q" formats in ribbon1.f (though it doesn't
seem to stop the program from working).  If anyone patches the source so
that xlf is happy without breaking it for all other machines, please
send me the diffs.  -EAM
