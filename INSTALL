To install Raster3D 
===================

1) copy the appropriate Makefile.xxx for your machine to Makefile

2) inspect the Makefile to make sure that it is appropriate for your site,
   and possibly edit the file to include TIFF or LIBIMAGE support.

   In order to build Raster3D so that it supports the direct output of
   TIFF image files you must
	1) Obtain and install the TIFF library. There are a number of
	   implementations available on the net.  I have been using
	   Sam Leffler's version 3.3beta, available via anonymous ftp
	   from sgi.com.
	2) Edit the INCLUDES and LIBS definitions in the Makefile,
	   INCLUDES = -DTIFF_SUPPORT
	   LIBS     = -ltiff

   On SGI machines you may want to build in support for direct output to
   image files compatible with the libimage utilities.  In this case you
   must
	1) Make sure that libimage.a is installed on your machine
	   (the source is on one of the optional installation kits in the
	   standard Irix distribution).
	2) Edit the INCLUDES and LIBS definitions in the Makefile,
	   INCLUDES = -DLIBIMAGE_SUPPORT
	   LIBS     = -limage

3) Install the package:
	make install

4) Go to the examples subdirectory and try running the example scripts
   to verify installation.

A sample installation on a DEC Alpha might go:
	cp Makefile.osf Makefile
	vi Makefile                    # to check options, etc
	make install

Notes -

	The install procedure does not automatically install the html
version of the documentation, nor does it print the PostScript version.

Known Problems and notes for specific operating systems
=========================================================================

=== Digital Unix ===

DEC's f90 compiler produces broken code for render.f when the optimization
level is set higher than -O1.   Use the f77 compiler or f90 -O1.

=== IBM/AIX ===

AIX V4.2 doesn't like the READONLY keyword in Fortran OPEN statements.
You can work around this by using the ACTION='READ' keyword for Fortran 90
(which is also OK in the AIX xlf compiler).  This change is required in
	render.f	line 875
	normal3d.f	line 565
The AIX compiler also doesn't like the Q formats, but that doesn't seem
to hurt anything.

=== OS/2 ===

Uwe Baumert reports the following:

I'm pleased to say that I was also able to compile your Raster3D package
under OS/2 (Linux will follow). I used f2c 19970211. I had to modify some
code (I got wrong iocontrols etc.).  
[EAM - He means the OPEN statements as described for AIX above]
I compiled against the libtiff-library (version 4.2). I used the one that
was included in the NETPBM-Port of Peter Meerwald (pmeerw@cosy.sbg.ac.at)
and is available from
ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/graphics/netpbm*.zip.
