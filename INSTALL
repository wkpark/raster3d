To install Raster3D 
===================

1) copy the appropriate Makefile.xxx for your machine to Makefile

2) inspect the Makefile to make sure that it is appropriate for your site,
   and possibly edit the file to include TIFF or LIBIMAGE support.

   In order to build Raster3D so that it supports the direct output of
   TIFF image files you must
	1) Obtain and install the TIFF library. There are a number of
	   implementations available on the net.  I have been using
	   Sam Leffler's version 3.4beta024, available via anonymous ftp
	   from sgi.com.
	2) Edit the DEFINES, INCLUDES and LIBS definitions in the Makefile,
	   DEFINES = -DTIFF_SUPPORT
	   LIBS     = -ltiff
	3) You may also wish to add the option -DTIFF_INVERT to the
	   DEFINES line (see notes below)

   On SGI machines you may want to build in support for direct output to
   image files compatible with the libimage utilities.  In this case you
   must
	1) Make sure that libimage.a is installed on your machine
	   (the source is on one of the optional installation kits in the
	   standard Irix distribution).
	2) Edit the DEFINES and LIBS definitions in the Makefile,
	   DEFINES = -DLIBIMAGE_SUPPORT
	   LIBS     = -limage

3) Install the package:
	make install

4) Go to the examples subdirectory and try running the example scripts
   to verify installation.

A sample installation on a DEC Alpha might go:
	cp Makefile.osf Makefile
	vi Makefile                    # to check options, etc
	make install

NOTES
=====

I am told that some applications used to print TIFF images
(notable among them Adobe Photoshop) fail to correctly interpret the
TIFF header tag which defines the image orientation.  As a work-around
for this problem I have added support for a conditional compilation
directive TIFF_INVERT.  If you find that your TIFF images end up
inverted after printing (particularly if you know that you will be
using PhotoShop), then you may wish to modify the Makefile to
read:
	DEFINES = -DTIFF_SUPPORT -DTIFF_INVERT
Note that applications which correctly read the TIFF header should 
work in either case; this workaround is just to fool the stupid ones
which think they already know the orientation without bothering to
look.

I don't have a linux machine or a SUN, so I haven't yet tested
Version 2.2 on these systems.  If you find any problems with these or
any other platforms please let me know.  The Makefile for HPUX 
involves a bit more customization than most of the others; if you run
into trouble during compilation, look carefully at the Makefile.
