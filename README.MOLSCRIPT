Those of you who are picking up the beta-test version of Raster3D 2.0
will not yet have the updated MOLSCRIPT which fully supports it.

I am trying to coordinate with Per Kraulis so that the "official" release
of Raster3D 2.0 will be paralleled by an update of MOSCRIPT to V1.4(?)
incorporating the newer code.

Please be patient.
