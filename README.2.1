The file Raster3D_2.1.tar.Z contains version 2.1 of RASTER3D.
It is a unified distribution which has been tested on the following 
machines:

	DECstation 5000 / Ultrix 4.3
	Alpha / OSF 3.0
	SGI Indigo / Irix 4.0.5F
	IBM RS6000 / AIX
	SUN Sparc  / SUNOS 4.1.3_U1
	Intel 486 / linux

New in version 2.1:

- updated documentation, including html versions
- new object types for rendering
	type 7:	explicit vertex normals for triangle
	type 8: special material properties for lighting model
	type 9: terminates previous special material, may be used as comment
- renamed "setup" to be "balls", in hope of avoiding conflicts with
  other system-dependent utilities called "setup"
- more accounting information reported in render


Other changes since first distribution of version 2.0:

- fixed bug in input format and accounting of PLANE objects
- added machine-independent utility filter avs2ps to produce dithered
  black&white PostScript output (supercedes machine-dependent stuff in
  viewtools)
- added patch for Molscript V1.4 so that dotted lines can be passed
  on to Raster3D
- fixed bug which could cause end of cylinder to have a bite out of it

The render program may be run with any one of four output modes
currently supported in the file local.c:
1) AVS-compatible output to stdout, intended for piping to ImageMagick
   or other image file format conversion program. (default behaviour).
2) SGI libimage output to file specified in command line using the 
   -sgi flag (e.g. render -sgi outfile.rgb). Support of this option
   is conditionally compiled into local.c, and is only relevant when
   Raster3D is to be installed on an SGI machine.
3) TIFF output file specified in command line using the -tiff flag.
   The option requires that the TIFF support library libtiff.a be
   separately obtained and installed before building Raster3D.
4) The -original option to render is intended to produce output on stdout 
   which is compatible with the original (UA/UBC) Raster3D versions, so that
   image post-processing programs (e.g. idither/hdith/dith2lp) may
   still be used.

Unless you specifically need libimage compatibility, I suggest
that you simply use the default AVS-compatible output, and use John Cristy's
ImageMagick package to view or process the output.  ImageMagick runs
nicely on any machine supporting X11R4 windowing, and may be obtained
via anonymous ftp from a number of sites, including export.lcs.mit.edu.

Using ImageMagick as a viewer, a typical command might look something like:

	cp  selected_view_from_viewing_program setup.matrix
	cat mycolors.pdb protein.pdb | rods | render | display avs:-

If you are running on an SGI machine and want to use the libimage utilities,
then the equivalent commands would be something like:

	cat mycolors.pdb protein.pdb | rods | render -sgi picture.rgb
	ipaste picture.rgb

The setup/rods/ribbon utilities now have a -h flag which suppresses output
of the Raster3D header records.  Using -h allows one to merge output
from the various utilities without an editing step.  For example, to draw a
ribbon backbone of an iron containing protein with spheres for iron
atoms:

	ribbon -d4 protein.pdb > ribbon.r3d
	grep FE protein.pdb | cat colors.pdb - | setup -h > irons.r3d
	cat ribbon.r3d irons.r3d | render | convert avs:- miff:rib+Fe.miff.Z

Finally, to render a figure and save the resulting image as a TIFF file
using ImageMagick:

	render < mypicture.r3d | convert avs:- tiff:mypicture.tiff

If you want to use a viewer which doesn't recognize AVS format image files,
then you may want to build the TIFF support into Raster3D. For example, to
create and view a TIFF file using the xv viewer:

	render -tiff mypicture.tiff < mypicture.r3d; xv mypicture.tiff
