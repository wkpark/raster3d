# This example uses the ribbon utility to render a view of the 
# E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) B-pentamer
# with each chain a different colour.
#
# First extract chains D-H (which form the pentamer)
# Only CA and O atoms are relevant to the ribbon program.
#
grep ' [DEFGH] ' LT.pdb > temp.tmp
#
# Now select pre-determined view matrix.
# As it happens, this one came from using MOLSCRIPT to compose the
# figure and then typing the matrix reported by MOLSCRIPT into a file.
# Other programs, e.g. FRODO, atoms, etc, will also dump a view matrix
# on request.
#
cp example1.matrix setup.matrix
#
# Add color information and draw ribbons;  -d5 means new colour for each chain.
# Pipe output to render and then display.
#
cat chaincolours.pdb temp.tmp | ribbon -d5 | render | display avs:-
#
#
#
rm -f temp.tmp setup.matrix
