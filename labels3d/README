labels3d V2.3b (beta test version)

The labels3d program is still under development. 
The final form may change more than slightly; in particular I may
rewrite the whole thing in Perl rather than Fortran.
Nevertheless, the present code may serve as a testbed for the
additional of Raster3D-compatible labels to other programs.

At the moment this directory contains

	labels3d.f		- Fortran source code (may change!)
	labeltest.r3d		- example of label use
	labeltest.jpeg		- image produced by running test script
	labels3d.ps		- intermediate PostScript file produced
				  by running test script
	labeltest.script	- the test script

The test script requires that you have preivously installed
	Raster3D (with TIFF support)
	ghostscript (with PPM driver)
	ImageMagick (for image compositing)

Other PostScript interpreters and image compositing tools could probably
be used instead, but I'm happy with the ghostscript/ImageMagick pair.
