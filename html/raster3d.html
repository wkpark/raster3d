The Raster3D molecular graphics package consists of a core program 
<a href="render.html">render</a> 
and a number of ancillary programs
which read atomic coordinates from Brookhaven PDB files to produce
scene descriptions for input to render. 
Raster3D can also render images composed using other programs such as 
<a href="#refs">Molscript</a> and 
<a href="http://www.scripps.edu/pub/dem-web/index.html">XtalView</a>.

<h4><a name="general">SYNOPSIS</a></h4>
<p>
Raster3D uses a fast Z-buffer algorithm to produce high quality pixel images
featuring one shadowing light source, additional non-shadowing light sources,
specular highlighting, transparency, and Phong shaded surfaces.
Output is in the form of a pixel image with 24 bits of color
information per pixel plus one matte channel.
</p>

<p>
Raster3D does not depend on graphics hardware. Four common image output
formats are supported: AVS, JPEG, TIFF, and SGI libimage.  To actually view or
manipulate the images produced, you must also have installed an image viewing
package (e.g. John Cristy's ImageMagick or the SGI libimage utilities).
The Raster3D rendering program can be integrated with ImageMagick to
expand the flexibility of output formats and interactive use.
</p>

<p>
Ancillary programs are provided for the generation of object
descriptions based on atomic coordinates stored in PDB format.
Although Raster3D is not intended as a general purpose ray-tracing program,
nothing in the rendering process is specific to molecular graphics. 
Some of the algorithms used have been chosen for speed rather than generality,
however. They work well for molecular graphics images, but possibly 
would produce odd results if used for very different types of image.
</p>

<p>
Raster3D currently supports rendering six object types: spheres,
triangles, planes, smooth-ended cylinders, round-ended cylinders,
and quadric surfaces.  It also supports the definition of material
properties (transparency, bounding planes, color, reflectivity)
that apply to groups of objects within the rendered scene.
</p>

<p>
Version 2.1 added support for additional "object types" which are
really modifiers for characteristic properties of existing objects.
These have since been expanded to include the specification of 
explicit surface normals, colors, and transparency at the vertices
of the current object.
</p>

<p>
Version 2.2 added support for transparency.
</p>

<p>
Version 2.3 added support for
file indirection, additional anti-aliasing options, internal
light sources, and a separate alpha blend (matte) channel in the rendered image. 
There is a new shell script, <a href="stereo3d.html">stereo3d</a>
to automatically generate a side-by-side stereo pair from a Raster3D input file.
</p>

<p>
Version 2.4 added support for
generalized quadric surfaces (ellipsoids, cones, etc).
Input lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments.
It introduced the utility program <a href="rastep.html">rastep</a>
which generates "thermal ellipsoid" representations of atoms based on the
Biso or Uij entries in a PDB file (ANISOU cards). The option of coloring 
based on B values was added here and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Version 2.5 added support for Z-clipping, output to a JPEG image
file on stdout, piped output to ImageMagick for automatic conversion to
additional image types, and file indirection of header records.
It also upgraded support for handling labels (object types
10,11,12) using PostScript. See 
<a href="r3dtops.html">r3dtops</a> and <a href="label3d.html">label3d</a>
documentation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Version 2.6</b> adds support for bounding planes, and removes the
previous limit on stacking transparent objects.  The installation process
has been modified so that all user-configurable options are collected into
the files <i>parameters.incl</i> and <i>Makefile.template</i>.
</p>

<h4>
<a name="examples">EXAMPLES</a></h4>
Using only programs included in the Raster3D distribution one can create and
render space-filling models, ball-and-stick models, ribbon models, and figures
composed of any combination of these. The following set of commands would
produce a composite figure of an Fe-containing metalloprotein with a smoothly
shaded ribbon representation of the protein and spheres drawn for the Fe atoms: 

<pre>
# 
# Draw smooth ribbon with default color scheme 2, 
# save description (with header records) in ribbon.r3d 
# 
cat protein.pdb | ribbon -d2 &gt; ribbon.r3d
# 
# Extract Fe atoms only, and draw as spheres. 
# Color info is taken from colorfile. 
# Save description (with no header records) in irons.r3d 
# 
grep ``FE'' protein.pdb | cat colorfile - | balls -h &gt; irons.r3d 
# 
# combine the two descriptions and render as AVS image file 
# 
cat ribbon.r3d irons.r3d | render &gt; picture.x
</pre>
One can alternatively use Molscript to produce a Raster3D 
input file by using the -r switch. Integrated use of
Molscript/Raster3D/ImageMagick allows one to describe, render, and view 3D
representations of existing Molscript figures. 

<pre>
molscript -r &lt; infile.dat | render | display avs:-
</pre>
A similar example using xv as an image viewer, and assuming that 
TIFF support has been built into the render program:

<pre>
molscript -r &lt; infile.dat | render -tiff image.tif 
xv image.tif
</pre>
The same image rendered as a side-by-side stereo pair:

<pre>
molscript -r &lt; infile.dat > input.r3d; stereo3d input.r3d; xv stereo.tiff

</pre>
The
Raster3D distribution also includes a filter utility which will convert the
24-bit color output stream from render into a dithered black &amp; white
PostScript image:

<pre>
render &lt; description.r3d | avs2ps &gt; picture.ps

</pre>

<h5>Required for full installation:</h5>
<dl>
    <dt>TIFF
    <dd>In order to build in support for the direct output of TIFF image files,
	you must separately obtain and install a copy of the TIFF library 
	(libtiff.a).  Several implementations are available, including one by 
	Sam Leffler which may be obtained via anonymous ftp from 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.sgi.com"> sgi.com</a>.
    <dt>JPEG
    <dd>In order to build in support for output of JPEG images you must have a
	copy of the JPEG library. If your system does not already have this
	library installed, you can obtain it directly from the Indepent JPEG Group development 
	project via anonymous ftp from 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/">ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/</a>.
    <dt>ImageMagick
    <dd>In order to view the rendered images on a workstation screen you must 
	also obtain and install an image viewer. 
	Two commonly available viewers are John Christy's 
	<a href="http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html">
	ImageMagick</a> 
	(also available via anonymous ftp from

	being printed as PostScript images.  The features of Raster3D version
	2.0 are supported by Moslcript version 1.4 (with a couple of additional
	patches that come in the Raster3D distribution).  To obtain Molscript
	please contact Per Kraulis directly (Email:
	<a href="mailto:pjk@avatar.se">pjk@avatar.se</a>). There is now a
	Molscript web page at

Several auxiliary programs are available from the ftp site above which may be
useful, though they have not been kept up to date with the current Raster3D
version. These include two attempts to aid in the composition of Raster3D
images (atoms, preras3d) and tools for conversion to half-toned monochrome
images and annotation and display of the images (viewtools). Most of the code
was written specifically for SGI workstations, and may not transport well to
other platforms.
