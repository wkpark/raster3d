STEREO3D
</h1>
<h4>
SYNOPSIS</h4>
stereo3d is a shell script that renders a single 
<a href="raster3d.html"> Raster3D </a> 
input file as a side-by-side stereo pair.
The resulting image is placed in file <b>stereo.tiff</b>.

<pre>
stereo3d [-border] render_input_file.r3d
</pre>

stereo3d uses the Raster3D utilities
<a href="label3d.html">label3d</a>,
<a href="normal3d.html">normal3d</a> and
<a href="render.html">render</a>,
and the utility programs identify, mogrify, and montage from
John Cristy's ImageMagick image processing package.
Three intermediate files are produced by normal3d:
<ul>
<li>stereo3d.tmp - normalized version of the input file
<li>left.r3d - header records for left eye view
<li>right.r3d - header records for right eye view
</ul>
Additional intermediate files may be produced by label3d.
The two views are separately rendered to yield images left.tiff and right.tiff
(deleted upon completion), optionally given black borders, and merged to form a single
side-by-side stereo pair stereo.tiff.

<h4>EXAMPLES</h4>
If the following line would render and display a single image:
<pre>
	render -tiff single.tiff < input.r3d;  display single.tiff
</pre>
then the following line would render and display the same scene
as a stereo pair instead:
<pre>
	stereo3d input.r3d; display stereo.tiff
</pre>
<b>NB</b>: The output image is always called stereo.tiff; there is no
provision at present to specify some other name.

<h4>OPTIONS</h4>
<dl>
<dt><i>-border</i></dt>
<dd>By default the left and right images are placed next to each other with no
intervening space and no frame around them.  The -border option requests a
4 pixel wide black border separating and surrounding the component images.</dd>
</dl>


<h4>ENVIRONMENT</h4>
This script requires TIFF support in render, the unix utility sed, and the
<a href="http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html">
ImageMagick</a> image processing package. The three intermediate files
listed above are created each time the script is run. Any exiting files
named left.tiff, right.tiff, or stereo.tiff will be destroyed.

The default version of stereo3d invokes the <a href="label3d.html">label3d</a>
script so that labels are processed in stereo also.  If label3d processing
is not configured on your machine you may want to replace the stereo3d
script with an alternate version named stereo3d_nolabels in the Raster3D
distribution package.
