STEREO3D
</h1>
<h4>
SYNOPSIS</h4>
stereo3d is a shell script that renders a single 
<a href="raster3d.html"> Raster3D </a> 
input file as a side-by-side stereo pair.

<pre>
stereo3d [options] [-png] [outfile.png ]  < infile.r3d > outfile.png
stereo3d [options]  -tiff [outfile.tiff]  < infile.r3d > outfile.tiff
</pre>

stereo3d uses the Raster3D utilities
<a href="label3d.html">label3d</a>,
<a href="normal3d.html">normal3d</a> and
<a href="render.html">render</a>,
and the ImageMagick image processing package.

<p>
Input is from <i>stdin</i>, output is to <i>stdout</i> unless explicitly 
given on the command line.  
Default output format is PNG, but TIFF output can be chosen instead.
Intermediate files are created in directory $TMPDIR, if defined, otherwise
in /usr/tmp.  
</p>

<p>
<font color=red><b>Note</b></font>: stereo3d has been rewritten for version 2.6e<br>
<ul>
<li>The syntax of the stereo3d command has been changed (V2.6d) to
match that of render. Input is from <i>stdin</i>, output is to <i>stdout</i> unless 
a filename is given as a parameter to the -tiff or -png switches.
<li>Earlier versions of stereo3d generated stereo separation by applying a
shear operator to the left and right images.  This is still the default, but the
new -angsep option allows you to instead generate stereo separation by rotation rather
than shear.  Neither method is perfect, so you can't win.  Below is a summary of
the weak points of the two methods.
</ul>
<pre>
                                shear           rotation
                                -----           --------
     Bounding planes            always bad      OK
     shadows                    often bad     	OK
     Z-clipping                 OK              serious problem
     specular highlights        OK              minor problem
</pre>
</p>

<h4>EXAMPLES</h4>
If the following line would render single image:
<pre>
	render -png single.png < input.r3d
</pre>
then the following line would render the same scene as a stereo pair instead:
<pre>
	stereo3d -png stereo.png < input.r3d
</pre>

<h4>OPTIONS</h4>
<dl>
<dt><i>-angsep</i></dt>
<dd>By default the stereo effect is created by applying a shear operator to
the left and right views. The -angset option instead creates stereo by 
offsetting the two views by an angular separation of +/- 2.5&deg; from the
original setting.
<dt><i>-border</i></dt>
<dd>By default the left and right images are placed next to each other with no
intervening space and no frame around them.  The -border option requests a
4 pixel wide black border separating and surrounding the component images.</dd>
<dt><i>-size HHHxVVV</i></dt>
<dd>Force the size of the left and right images to HHHxVVV pixels, 
overriding whatever values are given in the input file.
</dl>


<h4>ENVIRONMENT</h4>
This script requires the
<a href="http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html">
ImageMagick</a> image processing package. 

The default version of stereo3d invokes the <a href="label3d.html">label3d</a>
script so that labels are processed in stereo also.  If label3d processing
is not configured on your machine you may want to replace the stereo3d
script with an alternate version named stereo3d_nolabels in the Raster3D
distribution package.
