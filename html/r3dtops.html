Raster3D to PostScript label conversion
</h1>

<h4>
SYNOPSIS</h4>

<listing>
    r3dtops [-fontscale xx] < infile.r3d > outfile.ps
</listing>

r3dtops reads an input file for the Raster3D
<a href="render.html">render</a> program, selects out only the
label descriptors 
<a href="render.html#obj10">(object types 10, 11, 12)</a>, 
and creates a 
PostScript file containing these labels and nothing else.
<p>
The r3dtops code can also be invoked inside render itself
using the <i>-labels</i> command line option. In this case
render produces two output files: one containing the rendered
image and another containing the PostScript label descriptions.
The PostScript file can be converted into a raster image by
ghostscript and then re-combined with the molecular graphics
image to yield a final composite image with both rendered
objects and labels.
This sequence of operations can be done manually, but
is generally done automatically by the 
<a href="label3d.html">label3d</a> script.

<h4>OPTIONS</h4>
<dl>
<dt><i>-fontscale</i>
    <dd>It is problematic to interpret the font sizes requested
    	in the font descriptor records so that they produce the
	desired size on the eventual output device or printer.
	By default the r3dtops program assumes that the eventual
	output device is approximately 100 dpi. The <i>-fontscale</i>
	option allows you to scale this up or down as necessary.
	The default scaling is multiplied by the parameter <i>xx</i>.
</dl>

<h4>SPECIAL CHARACTERS</h4>
A small number of escaped characters are allowed in the label text string. 
These may be useful for tweaking the position of your labels:
<listing>
	\n	new line
	\b	backspace
	\v	vertical tab (move up 1/2 line)
</listing>


<h4>EXAMPLE</h4>
To extract label identifiers and prepare a PostScript version of
the labels for eventual printing on a 300 dpi printer:
<listing>
r3dtops -fontscale 3.0 < infile.r3d > outfile.ps
</listing>


<h4>BUGS</h4>
<dl>
<dd>
The whole nature of label handling in Raster3D is not yet settled.
It would be much nicer if all the label processing were taken
care of by the render program itself.<p>
<dd>
Labels always appear on top of the molecular graphics image,
even labels which should be occluded by a foreground object.<p>
</dl>
