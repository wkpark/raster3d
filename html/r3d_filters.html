<a name="grasp">
<h4>grasp/ungrasp</h4></a>
<p>
Grasp (<a href="http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/honiglab_public/index.php/Software">home page</a>)
is a molecular visualization tool that to the best of my knowledge is available
only for SGI workstations and some older versions of Windows. Grasp itself does
not produce Raster3D output, but the molecular surfaces calculated 
by grasp can be saved to a file and then converted to a Raster3D input
description.  The filter program that does this conversion is called
"ungrasp", and is part of the Raster3D source distribution. The 
ungrasp source code and notes on using it are in the ./grasp/ subdirectory
of the Raster3D source tree.

<a name="msms">
<h4>MSMS</h4></a>
<p>
MSMS 
(<a href="http://www.scripps.edu/pub/olson-web/people/sanner/html/msms_home.html">original home page</a>)
is another program that calculates molecular surfaces, and has a number of advantages over
grasp. Although you may still be able to download MSMS itself, it has been replaced by
a newer python-based tool PMV
(<a href="http://mgltools.scripps.edu/">home page</a>).

Two filter programs to convert MSMS output files into Raster3D input files are
provided in the Raster3D source distribution. One is a perl script. The other is C source
code.  Both are in the ./examples/msms subdirectory of the source tree, and by default 
are installed permanently in /usr/local/share/Raster3D/examples/msms/.
