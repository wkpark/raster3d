#  Here is an example of specifying a double-sided material
#  The front uses default header values for IPHONG, SPECULAR, etc
#  and takes its color (in this case) from the individual objects.
#  The back side is colored (in this case) greenish-grey, and again
#  uses the default header values for IPHONG, SPECULAR.
