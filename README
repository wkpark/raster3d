The file Raster3D_2.7c.tar.gz contains the full source distribution for
version 2.7c of Raster3D.

  See CHANGELOG for a history of changes to the package.

- In a nutshell, the installation procedure is:

  	1)  Review the contents of Makefile.template
	2)  make help            (prints a list of OS names)
	3)  make OS              (where OS is your operating system name)
	4)  make all		 (builds the programs)
	5)  make install         (copies files to system directories)
	6)  modify user login environment to include R3D_LIB 
		e.g. setenv R3D_LIB /usr/local/share/Raster3D/materials

	7)  (optional)
	    modify ImageMagick delegates file so that ImageMagick recognizes
	    *.r3d files by default.  On my systems this file is in
	    	/usr/lib/ImageMagick/modules/coders/delegates.mgk
	    Add the following 2 lines at the end of the file
		r3d=>
	            render -png %o < %i
	    Newer versions of ImageMagick use XML format. In this case
	    instead add the line
	    	<delegate decode="r3d" command='render -png "%o"<"%i"' />

- Changes in Version 2.7 compared to 2.6
	+ change default image output of all programs to PNG
	+ trivial changes to code and documentation
	+ re-organized linux rpm generation
	+ Makefile option for sun-forte compiler
	+ label3d and stereo3d scripts try to accommodate multiple
	  versions of ImageMagick and ghostscript

This distribution has been tested on the following platforms:

	Alpha / OSF 4.0 / Tru64 5.1
	SGI / Irix 6.2 6.5
	IBM RS6000 / AIX
	SUNOS (g77/gcc)
	x86 (Intel, AMD) linux (Mandrake 8.1, 9.0, 9.2)  (g77/pgf77)

Previous versions have been tested under Irix 5.3 and the Cygwin
environment for Windows.  If you run into installation problems, please let
me know, particularly if you can also tell me what you did to fix it!

For optimal use of Raster3D you should also obtain 
John Cristy's ImageMagick package for image manipulation and viewing 
	(source distribution available from www.ImageMagick.org)
Some version of a TIFF library, ideally one that allows LZW compression 
	(this may be hard due to recent licensing issues!)
Some version of a JPEG library
Some recent version of the PNG library (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
Version 2.0 or greater of Molscript (http://www.avatar.se/molscript)
