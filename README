The file Raster3D_2.6f.tar.gz contains the full source distribution for
version 2.6f of Raster3D.

  See CHANGELOG for a history of changes to the package.

- The installation procedure for version 2.6 differs from earlier versions.
  In a nutshell, the necessary steps are:

  	1)  Review the contents of Makefile.template
	2)  make help            (prints a list of OS names)
	3)  make OS              (where OS is your operating system name)
	4)  make all		 (builds the programs)
	5)  make install         (copies files to system directories)
	6)  modify user login environment to include R3D_LIB 
		e.g. setenv R3D_LIB /usr/local/share/Raster3D/materials

	7)  (optional)
	    modify ImageMagick delegates file so that ImageMagick recognizes
	    *.r3d files by default.  On my systems this file is in
	    	/usr/lib/ImageMagick/modules/coders/delegates.mgk
	    Add the following 2 lines at the end of the file
		r3d=>
	            render -tiff %o < %i
	    Newer ImageMagick versions use an XML delegates file. In this case
	    add the line:
	        <delegate decode="r3d" command='render -png "%o" < "%i" ' />

- Changes in Version 2.6f compared to earlier versions
	+ RPM built against newer libraries for compatibility with 
	  Mandrake 8.2/9.0 Redhat 7.3/8.0
	+ RPM installation handles newer ImageMagick delegates format (XML)
	+ image format defaults to PNG everywhere (TIFF is deprecated)

- Changes in Version 2.6e compared to earlier versions
	+ All programs now use $TMPDIR for scratch files
	+ The stereo3d and label3d scripts have been re-written for /bin/sh
	  such that the syntax now matches that of render
	  	stereo3d [-png] < infile > outfile
	  See documentation for other changes to these scripts
	+ normal3d now allows stereo pairs generated by true rotation rather
	  than by a shear operation.  Both choices have some drawbacks.
	  The default remains to use a shear.
	+ various bug fixes and modifications for cross-platform
	  code compatibility

This distribution has been tested on the following platforms:

	Alpha / OSF 4.0 / Tru64 5.1
	SGI / Irix 6.2 6.5
	IBM RS6000 / AIX
	SUNOS (g77/gcc)
	Intel Pentium / linux (Mandrake 9.0)  (g77/pgf77)

Previous versions have been tested under Irix 5.3 and the Cygwin
environment for Windows.  If you run into installation problems, please let
me know, particularly if you can also tell me what you did to fix it!

For optimal use of Raster3D you should also obtain 
John Cristy's ImageMagick package for image manipulation and viewing 
	(source distribution available from www.ImageMagick.org)
Some version of a TIFF library, ideally one that allows LZW compression
Some version of a JPEG library
Version 1.0.6 or greater  of the PNG library (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
Version 2.0 of Molscript (http://www.avatar.se/molscript)
