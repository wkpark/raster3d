The file Raster3D-2.9-1.tar.gz contains the full source distribution for
version 2.9-1 of Raster3D.

  See CHANGELOG for a history of changes to the package.

- In a nutshell, the installation procedure is:

  	1)  Review the contents of Makefile.template
	2)  make help            (prints a list of OS names)
	3)  make OS              (where OS is your operating system name)
	4)  make all		 (builds the programs)
	5)  make install         (copies files to system directories)
	6)  modify user login environment to include R3D_LIB 
		e.g. setenv R3D_LIB /usr/local/share/Raster3D/materials

	7)  (optional)
	    modify ImageMagick delegates file so that ImageMagick recognizes
	    *.r3d files by default.  On my systems this file is in
	    	/usr/lib/ImageMagick-6.3.2/config/delegates.xml
	    Add the following line
	    	<delegate decode="r3d" command='"render" < "%i" > "%o"' />

- Changes in Version 2.9 compared to 2.7s
	+ compatible with gfortran and intel compilers
	+ new code in rastep to support Skittles validation 

If you run into installation problems, please let me know,
particularly if you can also tell me what you did to fix it!

For optimal use of Raster3D you should also obtain 
John Cristy's ImageMagick package for image manipulation and viewing
