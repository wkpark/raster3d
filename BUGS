All platforms
=============

      ==> gfortran version 4.6.1 has a compiler bug that prevents compiling
          rastep with -O3.  Use -O2 instead, up update your compiler.

      ==> ImageMagick keeps on changing their option syntax and delegates
	  file format.  You may have to tweak the calls to ImageMagick
	  utilities in the stereo3d and label3d scripts to match your local
	  version of ImageMagick.

      ==> Stereo pairs can be generated by using either a shear operation or
      	  by using an angular offset.  Both have problems.  The shear distorts
	  bounding surfaces.  The angular offset displaces specular highlights
	  and totally breaks Z-clipping.

	- ISOLATE (object code 15) not yet implemented for quadric surfaces
	- Z-clipped objects cast un-clipped shadows.
	- The mixed Fortran/C calls to local() generate an interesting 
	  variety of compiler warnings because of inadequte type-casting
	  on the Fortran side.  
	- General quadric surfaces (other than ellipsoids) may cast spurious
	  shadows, and always fail to shadow themselves.
	- Explicit vertex colors take precedence over material colors;
	  (That's a feature, not a bug)
	- Labels with TeX-like escape sequences are always treated as Left-Align.
	- ribbon coloring scheme 6 doesn't work

AIX 
===
	File indirection in render doesn't work, because opening Fortran
	LUN 6 clobbers C I/O in local.c
	Work-around : 
		Patch file render_patch.aix modifies render to use
		LUNs 5,4,3,2,1 for file indirection rather than 6,7,...
	dispose='delete' not permitted in open statement
	Work-around :
		None; temp files accumulate until deleted
