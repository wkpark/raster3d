AIX V 4.2
	File indirection in render doesn't work, because opening Fortran
	LUN 6 clobbers C I/O in local.c
	Work-around : 
		Patch file render_patch.aix modifies render to use
		LUNs 5,4,3,2,1 for file indirection rather than 6,7,...

Linux (Redhat 4.2)
	some problems with the code generated by gcc (abs(x) < 0 !?) in
	quadric.f.  I tweaked the source to work around the problem, but
	it may recur elsewhere.  g77 compiler doesn't like the Q formats
	in ribbon1.f

Windows
	I am relying entirely on the instructions kindly provided by 
	Suhaib Siddiqi, and have not tested the installation procedure at all.
	In particular I haven't done anything about adding the label-handling 
	code to the Makefile.

All platforms
=============
	- ISOLATE (object code 15) not yet implemented for quadric surfaces
	- Linear depth-cueing code (FOG 0) is not correct for parts of the 
	  scene behind a transparent object. This problem arises because a 
	  linear fog model does not correspond to reality. 
	  It would be possible to handle transparency correctly for an 
	  exponential fog model, but doesn't seem worth the effort right now.
	- Z-clipped objects cast un-clipped shadows.
	- The mixed Fortran/C calls to local() generate an interesting 
	  variety of compiler warnings because of inadequte type-casting
	  on the Fortran side.  
	- General quadric surfaces (other than ellipsoids) may cast spurious
	  shadows, and always fail to shadow themselves.
	- Explicit vertex colors take precedence over material colors;
	  I'm not sure whether that's good or bad.
	- The stereo3d script doesn't know about label processing
	  (should call label3d rather than render if labels are present).
