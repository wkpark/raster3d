Digital Unix (3.0 - 4.0)
	somewhere between -O1 and -O2 the f90 compiler breaks transparency
	coloring in example6.  f77 compiler does fine.

Digital Unix 4.0
	compiling render with f77 -g crashes the compiler (?!)
	compiling with optimization instead -O1 -> -O5 still works

Irix 6.4
	compiling with f77 -g crashes this compiler also (?!)

AIX V 4.2
	xlf has odd notions of Q format (normal3d.f, ribbon.f)
	File indirection in render doesn't work, because opening Fortran
	LUN 6 clobbers C I/O in local.c
	Work-around : 
		Patch file render_patch.aix causes render to use
		LUNs 5,4,3,2,1 for file indirection rather than 6,7,...

Linux (Redhat 4.2)
	some problems with the code generated by gcc (abs(x) < 0 !?) in
	quadric.f.  I tweaked the source to work around the problem, but
	it may recur elsewhere.

All platforms
=============
	ISOLATE (object code 15) not yet implemented for quadric surfaces
