Digital Unix (3.0 - 4.0)
	somewhere between -O1 and -O2 the f90 compiler breaks transparency
	coloring in example6.  f77 compiler does fine.

AIX 4.2
	doesn't like READONLY or CARRIAGECONTROL in OPEN statements
	(render.f and normal3d.f) 
	READONLY can be replaced by ACTION='READ'
	xlf also has odd notions of Q format (normal3d.f, ribbon.f, labels3d.f)
Linux
	flavors vary, may encounter same dislike as AIX for options in
	OPEN statements (render.f and normal3d.f) and Q format
