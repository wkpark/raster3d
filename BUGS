Digital Unix (3.0 - 4.0A/B)
	Somewhere between -O1 and -O2 the f90 compiler breaks transparency
	coloring in example6. Works OK starting in DU 4.0D.

AIX V 4.2
	File indirection in render doesn't work, because opening Fortran
	LUN 6 clobbers C I/O in local.c
	Work-around : 
		Patch file render_patch.aix causes render to use
		LUNs 5,4,3,2,1 for file indirection rather than 6,7,...

Linux (Redhat 4.2)
	some problems with the code generated by gcc (abs(x) < 0 !?) in
	quadric.f.  I tweaked the source to work around the problem, but
	it may recur elsewhere.  g77 compiler doesn't like the Q formats
	in ribbon1.f

All platforms
=============
	- ISOLATE (object code 15) not yet implemented for quadric surfaces
	- Linear depth-cueing code (FOG 0) is not correct for parts of the 
	  scene behind a transparent object. This problem arises because a 
	  linear fog model does not correspond to reality. 
	  It would be possible to handle transparency correctly for an 
	  exponential fog model, but doesn't seem worth the effort right now.

	- The mixed Fortran/C calls to local() generate an interesting 
	  variety of compiler warnings because of inadequte type-casting
	  on the Fortran side.
