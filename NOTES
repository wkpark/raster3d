- Build stereo directly into render (removes dependence on ImageMagick)
  As an interim measure, switch stereo3d processing to always use png
- Depth occlusion of labels
- Peanuts
- perl script to take *.obj file format -> *.r3d

=============

Only light testing cross-platform
I plan to strip down the Makefile to the bare minimum
Still some compiler warnings to deal with

Labels
- render doesn't load IDET(LABEL);  why not?  
  Is it keeping label details in the sorted lists?
- If we were to store the label Z coord in the alpha slot of the pixels
  array (not enough precision, probably needs a separate array) then
  graph pixels could be drawn directly into the label image but only
  if the Z coord of the graph pixel is greater than that of the label.
- I think that would work except that you couldn't see labels through
  a transparent object

V3.0 seems to be 20% slower than V2.9

Static build automation is a mess.
  I've hardwired LDFLAGS that allow it to work on Mandriva 10.1
  Current procedure to build the static version is:
    copy raster3d-shared-3.0-0.spec to raster3d-3.0-0.spec
    edit Makefile.package to have the correct target architecture
    make rpm
    rename the resulting rpms to contain "-static-"
