<h1 align=center> NORMAL3D </h1>

<h4>SYNOPSIS</a></h4>

<b>normal3d</b> reads a Raster3D input file from <i>stdin</i>, applies
any coordinate manipulations specified in the header, and writes the
modified file to <i>stdout</i>.  <br>

<listing>
normal3d [-h] [-expand] [-stereo] &lt; infile.r3d &gt; normalized.r3d
</listing>

The output file from <b>normal3d</b> describes exactly the same image as the
original input file. Header records are left unchanged except for
the transformation matrix (which becomes the identity matrix) and the
format specifiers (which are set to *). <p>

The <i>-h</i> flag suppresses all header
records in the output file.  All objects in the input file
are also in the output file, but their coordinate descriptions have been
normalized (i.e. the original transformation matrix has been
applied).<p>

The <i>-expand</i> flag causes the program to
In-line and normalize all instances of file indirection in the input stream.
This results in a single render input file containing no file indirection.
The default is to simply copy file indirection lines (those begining
with @) to the new input file without opening them or normalizing their
contents.<p>

The <i>-stereo</i> flag causes the program to produce two additional files,
<i>left.r3d</i> and <i>right.r3d</i>, containing header records suitable
for rendering the normalized object description file as a side-by-side
stereo pair (see 
<a href="stereo3d.html">stereo3d</a>).<p>

<b>normal3d</b> also reports the total number of objects in the input file by
object type, and gives the array sizes which would be required for the
<b>render</b> program to process this file. It may therefore be used to
determine how large the 
<a href="render.html#arrays">array sizes in render</a> 
should be set, should one
of your image descriptions exceed the values compiled into <b>render</b>.<p>

<h4> EXAMPLES</h4>
Feed a large file through <b>normal3d</b> to judge array size requirements for rendering:

<listing>

normal3d < largeinputfile.r3d > /dev/null

 tmat (v' = v * tmat):
 -0.7543700     0.2779890     -0.6327600    0.0000000E+00
  8.3310001E-02 0.9392580      0.3367110    0.0000000E+00
  0.6530600     0.2012850     -0.6973090    0.0000000E+00
  -54.14897     -48.99439      -13.01923     25.00000
 -------------------------------
 spheres   =    67
 cylinders =  5128
 triangles = 23402
 -------------------------------
 Compare these to the array dimensions in render:
 special materials =      1 (check against MAXMAT)
 total objects     =  47402 (check against MAXOBJ)
 details           = 506943 (check against MAXDET)
 shadow details    = 364323 (check against MAXSDT)
 -------------------------------
 True center of input coordinates (not used):
 -0.7435400 3.0629992E-02 -0.4582600
