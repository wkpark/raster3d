<a name="shadowing">
<b><i>Shadowing:</i></b></a>
The primary purpose of shadowing is to convey a feeling of depth in
the rendered image. This can be particularly effective when there are a
relatively small number of elements in the scene, or when there is a grouping
of foreground objects which cast shadows onto a separate grouping of background
objects. However if there are a large number of elements in the scene, e.g. a
ribbon and arrow representation of a large molecular assembly, the use of
shadows may actually complicate the visual impact and make the image less
satisfactory. In this case you may wish to try rendering the image both with
and without shadows, or you might experiment with the location of the primary
light source (the SOURCE parameter in the 12th header record input to
<b><i>render</i></b>). Finally, you can de-emphasize the shadows by increasing
the secondary (straight-on) light source contribution parameter.<p>

<a name="output device">
<b><i>Tailoring your image to the output device:</i></b></a>
The quality of pictures generated by
Raster3D is ultimately limited by the output device. Although you will probably
compose and preview your figures on a workstation screen, you will probably
want to re-render the final version with a larger number of pixels before
sending it to a film recorder or high performance color printer. For example, a
typical film recorder can produce slides with a resolution of roughly 4000x3000
pixels (much larger than can be displayed on a workstation screen). The number
of pixels in your rendered image is controlled by the parameters (NTX,NTY) and
(NPX,NPY) in the 2nd and 3rd header records input to the render program. You
should also be aware that color balance and particularly the appropriate
``gamma correction'' varies from one device to another. Raster3D itself applies
no gamma correction; if you need one you will have to apply it to the generated
image files afterwards. This is a standard image processing procedure, and may
be a selectable print option for your output device. If you will be using a
particular output device regularly, it is worth an initial round of
experimentation to determine the best gamma value for future runs. The
appropriate gamma correction can then be applied to the each rendered picture
before sending it for printing.<p>

<a name="stereo1">
<b><i>Side-by-side figures and stereo pairs:</i></b></a>
The EYEPOS parameter input to the render
program specifies a viewing distance for the resulting image. You may think of
this as equivalent to the distance between a camera and the object being
photographed. Generally the sense of depth conveyed by the rendered image is
slightly increased by positioning the virtual camera reasonably close to the
object; the default recommended value for EYEPOS is 4, which means that
distance from the camera to the center of the object is four times the width of
the field of view. However, if you are composing a figure containing two or
more similar objects which are next to each other, e.g. a comparison of two
variants of the same protein structure, the resulting parallax may be more of a
hindrance than a help. Since the virtual camera is centered it will ``see'' the
right hand object slightly from the left, and the left hand object slightly
from the right. This results in different effective viewpoints for paired
objects which would otherwise be identical. To overcome this effect you may
wish to set EYEPOS to some large value, which will generate an image with
effectively no parallax. The same considerations apply for the production of
stereo pairs.<p>

<a name="stereo2">
<b><i>Stereo pairs and Molscript:</i></b></a>
Unfortunately Molscript does not pass any
information about area, page layout, or even aspect ratio, on to the Raster3D
input file. This means that all objects emitted by a Molscript run are simply
placed into a single raster grid description. I.e., the pairs of ``plot'' and
``end plot'' statements in a Molscript input file have no effect in Raster3D
mode. Note that the header records controlling this grid are taken from file
header.r3d if it exists, otherwise there is an internal set of header records
which Molscript uses by default. Therefore a Molscript file which describes a
stereo pair as two separate plots will not work correctly when fed through to
render. To produce a Raster3D stereo pair starting from a Molscript file you
have a number of options:
<ul>
<li>	Describe the pair within a single Molscript plot rather than as two
separate plots.
<li>	Use two Molscript plots, but split them into separate runs. You can then
generate two separate Raster3D images which may be pasted side-by-side either
electronically (see below) or physically.
<li>	Work from a single Molscript image and generate the stereo pair by
manipulating the header records for render. This is what I normally do. The
steps of the process are:
    <ol>
    <li>Run Molscript to generate an input file for render. Molscript
transforms all coordinates so that the view matrix is an identity matrix with
scale 1.0
    <li>Run this input file through render. You now have the right half of a
stereo pair.
    <li>Edit the header records so that the view matrix described by TMAT (see
render documentation) is the one given below. This matrix describes a shear
operation, which is more correct than a pure rotation matrix for the purpose of
generating stereo images.

<listing>
	1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0
	0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0
	.05&nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1
	0.&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.0
</listing>
    <li>Run the edited input file through render. You now have the left half of
a stereo pair.
    <li>You can either print the two images separately and mount them side by
side, or merge them electronically before printing. I use the montage command
of ImageMagick to combine the separate raster images into a single double-width
image containing the stereo pair. Here is an ImageMagick command which will
combine a left and a right image, each 500x500 pixels, into a single stereo
pair:
<listing>
montage -geometry 500x500+0+0! -borderwidth 0 +frame -label ```` \ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; left.tiff right.tiff stereo.tiff
</listing>
    <li>If you compose separate header files in advance, one in which the TMAT
records describe the identity matrix and another in which TMAT describes the
shear matrix, then this procedure can be automated. Note that creating an empty
file header..r3d will cause Molscript to produce an output file with no header
records. Here is a sample shell script:
<listing>
#
# Make sure header file is empty
#
rm header.r3d
touch header.r3d
#
# render image twice, once with header for right, once for left
#
molscript -r &lt; image.mol &gt; image.r3d
cat right_header.r3d image.r3d | render -tiff right.tiff
cat left_header.r3d &nbsp; image.r3d | render -tiff left.tiff
#
# combine left and right images into single stereo pair
#
montage [...options...] left.tiff right.tiff stereo.tiff
</listing>
    </ol>
</ul>

<a name="colours">
<b><i>Creating your own colour descriptions:</i></b> </a>
The Raster3D distribution contains a number of
pre-defined colouring schemes (e.g. the shapely.colours file, cpk.colours, and
mycolors.pdb). If you choose to modify these, or create your own, then you
should be aware that render works internally with the square root of the
specified colour values (yes it's a very strange concept!). To convert a normal
RGB colour triple into a Raster3D color specification it is therefore necessary
to square each component. For example, to specify a half-intensity yellow you
would square the components of the pure RGB triplet (0.5, 0.5, 0.0) to yield
(0.25, 0.25, 0.0) in the COLOUR record input to render. The Raster3D output
option to Molscript performs this conversion automatically, so you should not
have to alter the colour specifications to switch between PostScript and
Raster3D modes.<p>

<a name="composing">
<b><i>Composing figures in other programs:</i></b></a>
Suppose you are already working in some
interactive graphics program, FRODO for instance, and wish to reproduce the
current viewpoint/orientation for a Raster3D picture.<b><i> </i></b>If the
program will dump the current view matrix then you will probably be able to use
it as a view matrix for Raster3D also. However many programs (including FRODO
and Molscript) dump a matrix which is the transpose of the matrix used by
Raster3D. <p>

Users of Alwyn Jones' program O
should obtain a copy of the program <b><i>o2mol</i></b> from the O ftp site.
Once you have composed your view in O you can convert to a Molscript/Raster3D
viewpoint description by dumping the O datablock named .GS_REAL

<listing>
O&gt; write_form .gs_real omatrix.dat
Heap&gt; Format: &lt;cr&gt;
</listing>
followed
by a shell command

<listing>
o2mol &lt; omatrix.dat &gt; o2mol.out
</listing>
The
file o2mol.out will now contain instructions for reproducing the O viewpoint in
Molscript. Also, the 3x3 matrix which o2mol gives as ``for coordinate
transforms'' is in the correct form to use directly as a Raster3D matrix if you
aren't processing with Molscript first.<p>


Another interactive tool you might be interested in is the
<b><i>VMD</i></b> program from the Theoretical Biophysics group at the
University of Illinois.  This is a new package for the graphical display
and visualization of biomolecular systems, available to the structural
biology research community free of charge. <b><i>VMD</i></b> provides a
wide variety of methods for interactively rendering and coloring a
molecule, and can generate a Raster3D input file which will very nearly
duplicate the view composed on your workstation screen.

A more complete description of VMD is available via the 
<a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu:1250/Research/vmd/"> VMD WWW home page</a>.  
The software itself is available via anonymous ftp from 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ks.uiuc.edu/pub/mdscope/vmd">
         ftp://ftp.ks.uiuc.edu/pub/mdscope/vmd</a>.

<a name="matrix">
<b><i>Building up a figure from Molscript and other files</i></b>:
When Molscript runs it normalizes the coordinates of objects in the figure
so that they are described by an identity transformation matrix.
The 3x3 matrix printed out by Molscript to the terminal is the transpose of
that needed by Raster3D programs.  Swap the entries
about the diagonal from upper left to lower right before copying it into
the TMAT header records for 
<a href="render.html">render</a> or <a href="normal3d.html">normal3d</a>.
<p>

To normalize other Raster3D input files describing objects still in the original
PDB coordinate space (so that they can be merged with your Molscript output),
replace the four TMAT records in the header with a new matrix built as below
and then feed the resulting file through <a href="normal3d.html">normal3d</a>.

in Molscript. The column values above it are <i>always</i> zero.<p>

<a name="labels">
<b><i>How can I keep the Molscript labels in my Raster3D picture?</i></b></a>
Yes, it <i>is</i> possible to keep the labels from a Molscript picture when
you convert it to Raster3D.  I don't recommend this procedure, but here is a 
<a href="r3d_labels.html"> summary of how to do it</a> if you really want to.
<p>

<a name="black-white">
<b><i>Black &amp; White figures:</i></b></a>
It is possible to use a general image
processing program (e.g. ImageMagick) to convert a color figure to a monochrome
figure. In general a straight conversion will produce an image which is much
too dark. In order to improve the result you can try breaking the conversion up
into several steps: first convert from full 24-bit color to a smaller number of
colors (say 256), next apply a substantial gamma correction (e.g. gamma&nbsp;
&nbsp; 2.0) to lighten the image, and finally convert the color image to
monochrome being sure to select a dithering option if it is available. Some
experimentation with this process can produce acceptable, although not ideal,
monochrome images suitable for printing on a standard laser printer. You may
have to repeat the color reduction and gamma correction steps before finally
converting to monochrome. Better results can be obtained by using the auxiliary
program <b><i>avs2ps</i></b> as a filter. This utility will convert any
AVS-format image, including the default output stream from
<b><i>render</i></b>, directly into a dithered black &amp; white PostScript
image. As of this writing the <b><i>avs2ps</i></b> program is included with the
Raster3D distribution.<p>
