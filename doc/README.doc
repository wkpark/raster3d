The *.l files are standard unix man pages to be filtered through nroff.
Install these files by moving them to the appropriate system directory,
probably either /usr/local/man/manl or /usr/man/man1.
In the latter case you may have to rename them so that the suffix is
"1" (number) rather than "l" (lower case L).

R3D_manual.pdf is a complete set of Raster3D documentation pages 
packaged into a PDF file.
