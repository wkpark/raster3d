Files
	avs2ps.l        render.l        rods.l
	raster3d.l      ribbon.l        balls.l

These are standard unix man pages to be filtered through nroff.
Install these files by moving them to the appropriate system directory,
probably either /usr/local/man/manl or /usr/man/man1.
In the latter case you may have to rename them so that the suffix is
"1" (number) rather than "l" (lower case L).

Files
	avs2ps.html        render.html        rods.html
	raster3d.html      ribbon.html        balls.html

These are hypertext versions of the PostScript documentation.  I do not 
know of any truly general conventions for where to install them, but
/usr/local/man/html seems a likely bet.

File
	docs.ps

This file contains a PostScript version of the complete Raster3D
documentation. It is formatted for printing to double-sided pages.
