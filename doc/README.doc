These are standard unix man pages to be filtered through nroff.
Install these files by moving them to the appropriate system directory,
probably either /usr/local/man/manl or /usr/man/man1.
In the latter case you may have to rename them so that the suffix is
"1" (number) rather than "l" (lower case L).

Files
	avs2ps.html        render.html        rods.html
	raster3d.html      ribbon.html        balls.html      normal3d.html
	r3d_hints.html     r3d_labels.html    r3d_transparent.html
	stereo3d.html      r3d_icon.gif       index_button.gif

These are hypertext versions of the PostScript documentation.  I do not 
know of any truly general conventions for where to install them, but
/usr/local/man/html seems a likely bet.

File
	manual.ps

This file contains a PostScript version of the complete Raster3D
documentation. It is formatted for printing to double-sided pages.
