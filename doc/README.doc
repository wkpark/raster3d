These are standard unix man pages to be filtered through nroff.
Install these files by moving them to the appropriate system directory,
probably either /usr/local/man/manl or /usr/man/man1.
In the latter case you may have to rename them so that the suffix is
"1" (number) rather than "l" (lower case L).

	r3d_animation.html     rastep.html            stereo3d.html

These are hypertext versions of the PostScript documentation.  I do not 
know of any truly general conventions for where to install them, but
/usr/local/man/html seems a likely bet.

	example2.jpeg        example8.jpeg        r3d_icon.gif
	example5.jpeg        example9.jpeg        rastep_options.gif

These are images refered to by the hypertext documenation.
They need to go into the same directory as the html files.

File
	manual.ps

This is a PostScript version of the complete Raster3D documentation. 
It is formatted for printing to double-sided pages.
