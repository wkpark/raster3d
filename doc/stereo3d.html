STEREO3D
</h1>
<h4>
SYNOPSIS</h4>
stereo3d is a shell script that renders a single 
<a href="raster3d.html"> Raster3D </a> 
input file as a side-by-side stereo pair.
The resulting image is placed in file <b>stereo.tiff</b>.

<listing>
stereo3d render_input_file.r3d
</listing>

stereo3d uses the Raster3D utilities
<a href="normal3d.html">normal3d</a> and
<a href="render.html">render</a>,
and the utility programs identify, mogrify, and montage from
John Cristy's ImageMagick image processing package.
Three intermediate files are produced by normal3d:
<ul>
<li>stereo3d.tmp - normalized version of the input file
<li>left.r3d - header records for left eye view
<li>right.r3d - header records for right eye view
</ul>
The two views are separately rendered to yield images left.tiff and right.tiff
(deleted upon completion), given black borders, and merged to form a single
side-by-side stereo pair stereo.tiff.

<h4>EXAMPLES</h4>
If the following line would render and display a single image:
<listing>
	render -tiff single.tiff < input.r3d;  display single.tiff
</listing>
then the following line would render and display the same scene
as a stereo pair instead:
<listing>
	stereo3d input.r3d; display stereo.tiff
</listing>
<b>NB</b>: The output image is always called stereo.tiff; there is no
provision at present to specify some other name.

<h4>ENVIRONMENT</h4>
This script requires TIFF support in render, the unix utility nawk, and the
<a href="http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html">
ImageMagick</a> image processing package. The three intermediate files
listed above are created each time the script is run. Any exiting files
named left.tiff, right.tiff, or stereo.tiff will be destroyed.
