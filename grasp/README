This directory contains a utility program "ungrasp" which will convert a
simple GRASP V1.1 surface file into a list of Raster3D objects.  
Similar conversion routines could of course be written for other surface
generation programs.

I hope that the new (version 2.2) support in Raster3D for transparent
surfaces will encourage the developers of programs such as GRASP to 
include an option for direct output of Raster3D files, but for now I have
to make due with non-ideal conversion utilities like this one.  

Here is a list of known problems:

- ungrasp does not know about all the possible types of information stored
  in a GRASP surface file.  Currently it can only deal with stored potentials
  and discrete color indexes.

- The potential and color indexes are stored in the file are associated with
  specific vertices, but they need to be used in describing Raster3D triangles.
  Since the three vertices of the triangle can have different colors, I take
  the average.  This works, but does not look nearly so nice as it would if
  there were a machanism for interpolating colors smoothly within the triangle.
  Yeah, it would be possible to add yet another object type to specify 
  per-vertex color informations in render, but I'd rather not.

- The ungrasp utility must be compiled and run on the same architecture machine
  as your GRASP executable.  I believe that means SGI only, but I could be
  wrong.
