				RASTER3D

PROGRAM:
	Raster3D is a set of tools for generating high quality raster 
	images of proteins or other molecules. The core program renders 
	spheres, triangles, and cylinders with specular highlighting,
	Phong shading, and shadowing using an efficient Z-buffer algorithm. 
	Ancillary programs process atomic coordinates from Brookhaven PDB 
	files into rendering descriptions for pictures composed of ribbons, 
	space-filling atoms, bonds, ball+stick, etc.  Raster3D can also be 
	used to render pictures composed in Per Kraulis' MOLSCRIPT program 
	in glorious 3D with highlights, shadowing, etc. (NB: you will need 
	MOLSCRIPT V1.(4?) to get the full benefit of this).  Output is to 
	pixel image files with 24 bits of color information per pixel.

AVAILABILITY:
	Raster3d is freely available but unsupported. 
	Programs for previewing and figure composition are written
	for IRIS4D workstations (GL graphics), but all other code is
	intended to be machine-independent. Version 2.0 is currently in 
	beta-test, please see README.2.0.beta for further information.
