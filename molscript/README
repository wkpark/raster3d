To use Molscript as an input driver for Raster3D you first need to
obtain a copy of Molscript version 1.4 from Per Kraulis.  
Earlier versions of Molscript supported only a very limited interface to
Raster3D (basically just CPK models).

You can contact Per Kraulis at the address:

	Per Kraulis, Ph.D.
	Pharmacia
	Biopharmaceuticals R&D, N62:5     phone +46 8 695 78 34
	S-112 87 Stockholm                fax   +46 8 695 40 82
	SWEDEN                            email per.kraulis@sto.pharmacia.se

This directory contains two subroutines which can be used to patch Molscript
version 1.4 to improve the interface to Raster3D.

The routine RASPLN (file raspln.f) replaces an older version of the same
routine in the Molscript source file graphics.f.  
The older version could produce odd results near the edges of a helix,
particularly if the Molscript "segments" parameter was too small. 
The new version is much more forgiving.
The new version also contains code to render all sides of a helix,
rather than just the front (visible) surface.  I hope that this code
will be selectable as an option in some future version of Molscript
(e.g. "set helixsolid = yes"), but for now it is by default disabled.

The routine GRLIND (file grlind.f) also needs to be inserted into the
Molscript source file graphics.f.  You must also edit a couple of other 
lines in graphics.f as described in step 4 below.
These changes will allow Molscript to output dotted lines in Raster3D mode.

=============================================================================
Step by step instructions:

1) Go to your Molscript source directory

2) Make backup copies of the original Molscript source files
   schematic.f and graphics.f

3) [OPTIONAL - only needed if you want to investigate the use of solid helices]
   Apply the patch file schematic.f.diff to the Molscript V1.4 source file 
   schematic.f 
   If you don't know how to apply a patch file, just skip this step and 
   don't worry about it.

4) Edit the Molscript V1.4 source file graphics.f 
   (a)	Replace the routine RASPLN with the contents of the file raspln.f 
	from the Raster3D distribution.
   (b)	Insert the file grlind.f into the graphics.f source file.
   (c)	Find SUBROUTINE GRLINE in the graphics.f source file.
	Just *before* the line (should be line 516)
		C Ignore if entirely outside of view
	Insert the following code fragment:
		C Ethan A Merritt Aug 1994
		C	for Raster3D draw dashed lines as a string of spheres
		      IF (RASTER .AND. (LINDSH(TOTGST).NE.0)) THEN
			CALL GRLIND( COO1, COO2 )
			RETURN
		      END IF

5) Rebuild and re-install Molscript

=============================================================================

NB: These patches are specifically for Molscript version 1.4, if you have 
an earlier version you will need to update it to 1.4 before doing
anything else. Hopefully this code will make its way into some subsequent 
version of Molscript so that patching is not necessary.
