To use Molscript as an input driver for Raster3D you first need to
obtain a copy of Molscript version 1.4 from Per Kraulis.  
Earlier versions of Molscript supported only a very limited interface to
Raster3D (basically just CPK models).

You can contact Per Kraulis at the address:

	Dr. Per Kraulis
	Center for Structural Biochemistry   phone: +46 8 608 9266
	The Karolinska Institute             fax:   +46 8 608 9290
	NOVUM                                email: pjk@oyster.csb.ki.se
	141 57 Huddinge
	SWEDEN

This directory contains a diff file which can be used to patch Molscript
version 1.4 so that dotted lines can be output in Raster3D mode.  You
should be able to use the unix patch utility to apply these diffs to the
file graphics.f in the Moslcript source distribution.  Even if you can't
make the patch program work the change is simple enough that you can
just apply it by hand.

NB: This patch is specifically for Molscript version 1.4, if you have 
any earlier version you will need to update it to 1.4 before doing
anything else. Hopefully this patch will make its way into
some subsequent version of Molscript.
