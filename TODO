=> label3d and stereo3d 
   ====================
  ** Normal3d should count ZCLIP and BOUNDING_PLANE objects and warn about
     incompatibility with stereo
   * should pass unrecognized parameters through to render

=> ImageMagick delegate file format has switched to XML
   And at least under Mandrake it now lives in /usr/lib/ImageMagick
   The installation script will have to detect this and behave accordingly

    <delegate decode="r3d" command='render -png "%o" < "%i" ' />

=> Newer (g95) Fortran compilers may not like the LOGICAL*2 type
  + change COMMON /OPTIONS/ .... INVERT, LFLAG to LOGICAL INVERT, LFLAG
    render.f r3dtops.f parse.f

- Makefile
  + the initial "make" help message should be expanded to describe the
    entire installation process

- Organization
  + break out routines TRANS, ASSERT, CHKRGB, PERSP, etc into separate file
    so that both render and rastep can use the same copies.
  + break out separate modules for processing of each object type (parallel
    to quadric and r3dtops).  will need to push current material and some
    other data values into /common/.
  + glowlights are a special case of this, since the cost is in the lighting 
    model code rather than the object processing.
  + Move to all keyworded input?

- Shadows of transparent objects

- rastep
  + Add an Suv matrix similar to the one shown by Martyn Winn
    (maybe better as a separate program)
  + option to comment each atom's ellipsoid in the output file?

- Header records
  + only 1 level of indirection possible; does anyone care?

- Go for donuts!

- FRONTCLIP/BACKCLIP
  + should I clip glowlights, or not?

- Labels
  + move r3dtops code to local.c or some other way to pipe
    the PostScript through "convert -page +0+0 ps:- labels.tiff"
  + -border option in label3d (or maybe in render itself?)

- Better error-recovery if input stream contains unrecognized lines
  + keep track of input lines so can report which one failed
  + skip problem line and keep going
  + if first line of indirect file is not a valid object type,
    assume there are header records present and try to skip them

- RAFTER/TAFTER in normal3d
  + option to apply vs pass through (right now it always applies)
  + documentation / example

- Documentation
  + FAQ - how to make movies?
  + better/more examples of animation
  + mention msms-to-r3d conversion filters
  + bounding planes (give an illustration)
    figure comparing bounding plane and Z-clipped objects for r3d_hints.html

- More examples
  Worms:  demonstrate use of -radius option in rods
  FOG
  bounding planes
  animation - add an MPEG or animated GIF image to the on-line manual
  	      and to the examples

- Additional global options (command line?)
  + Autocenter/translate coordinates on completion of input

- Texture maps

- New Object types
	round-ended quadrics (color bounding sphere during truncation)
	NURBS

- Benchmark example 6 in POVray or some other popular ray-tracing code.

- Add cylinder-generation mode also.
  DNA/RNA options:  simple helix (end-to-end cylinders) through backbone
		    ribbon through backbone with normal facing ribose
		    ladder rungs to represent base pairs
		    solid purine/pyrimidine idealized bricks
